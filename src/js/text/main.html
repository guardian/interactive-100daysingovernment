                David Cameron claimed recently that the government had not wasted a day
                since it was elected and that everything it did was guided by the “good
                book” (the manifesto). In many respects the manifesto has provided a reliable
                roadmap, but in others the government has diverted quite strikingly
                from what was on offer to the electorate in May.
            </p>
            <p class="dig-standfirst">
                With the government marking its first 100 days in office on Saturday,
                Andrew Sparrow has assembled a list of the most important 100 things it
                has done in those 100 days to see what they say about Cameron’s first
                Tory-only government.
